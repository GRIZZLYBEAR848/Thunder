The Thunder were determined to keep Westbrook and held off all trade talks in order work out an extension.On August 4, 2016, Westbrook signed a three-year, $85.7 million contract extension with the Thunder.In the Thunder's second game of the season on October 28, Westbrook recorded his 38th career regular-season triple-double with 51 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a 113–110 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns, marking the first 50-point triple-double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had one in 1975. Westbrook also took a career-high 44 shots.Two days later, he recorded 33 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists in a 113–96 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, joining Magic Johnson, Jerry Lucas and Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history with two triple-doubles in the first three games of a season.On November 25, he had his sixth triple-double of the season with 36 points, 17 assists and 12 rebounds in a 132–129 overtime win over the Denver Nuggets.The following night, he recorded his second straight triple-double and NBA-best seventh of the season with 17 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds in a 106–88 win over the Detroit Pistons.
